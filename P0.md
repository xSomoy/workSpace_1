<b> My Proposal: </b>
```
Hi,
Let me briefly explain my expertise in Linux and Shell Scripting.
I have developed a software using only Shell Scripting. All by my own.
You can check out my software [ Searchit ], available in my GitHub. [ https://github.com/BlackPearlTech/SearchitTerminal ] 
Despite that I'm using Linux about 5 years. During this time I have build various tools for my personal use. 
I like to make tools/scripts to automate my Linux uses. [ I just love Linux ❤️ ] 
TLDR : I will not disappoint you, and you will have as many reviews as you want.
Hope you will give me chance to work with you. For further discussion hop into chat. 
Thank you so much.  
```
